// Idea: Use triangular numbers.
// Reason: Notice that the numbers go from 1 to c in a zig zag manner. This means
// that all the numbers from 1 to c will be in the top left part of the triangle.
// Triangular number's formula, 2 * c = n + (n + 1) will give us the filled diagonal of the triangle.
// Using the value of the triangle from the formula, we can deduct c from it.
